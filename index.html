        <h2>About Campus of College of Engineering and Architecture</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the unofficial "About" section of the College of Engineering at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP). Here, we invite you to delve into the remarkable journey and significant contributions of our esteemed institution:

          With roots dating back to 1904 as the Manila Business School (MBS) and subsequently evolving into the Philippine College of Commerce (PCC) in 1952, our College of Engineering (CoE) emerged as a prominent academic unit dedicated to providing specialized education in engineering disciplines. Our programs encompass Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and more.
          
          In 1978, a significant milestone transformed the PCC into the renowned Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) under Presidential Decree No. 1341. Since then, our CoE has flourished as a leading hub of engineering education and research.
          
          Driven by a commitment to growth and adaptability, the College of Engineering has expanded its program offerings to include a diverse range of engineering disciplines, such as Electronics Engineering, Industrial Engineering, and Computer Engineering. This expansion enables us to cater to the evolving needs of the industry and provide students with comprehensive, up-to-date education.
          
          Our academic excellence is affirmed through accreditation by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), and we have achieved Level IV accreditation from the Accrediting Agency of Chartered Colleges and Universities in the Philippines (AACCUP).
          
          Embracing technological advancements, we foster a culture of innovation within the College of Engineering. Join us on our mission as we continue to shape the future of engineering education and empower the next generation of engineering leaders.
          
          Thank you for visiting our website, and we encourage you to explore further to discover the exciting opportunities that await you at the College of Engineering, PUP.</p>
